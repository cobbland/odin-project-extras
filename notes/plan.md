# Computer Science Education Plan

An independent study of Computer Science and related disciplines. 

## The Plan

The plan is to take a two-ponged approach. First, focus on learning full-stack web development (so I can get a job sooner). While doing that, see if I can find any overlap with obtaining the equivalent of a bachelor’s degree education in Computer Science. 

## Full-Stack Web Development

I should choose the option that best aligns with my other goals. (What does that mean? Starting with the same language?)

- [The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) (I already have this downloaded. This is what Ben recommended, though rumblings online say the content might be out-of-date.)
- [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) (Visually, I like the look of this one best, I think.)
- **[The Oden Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)** (Most people seem to recommend this one.)
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) (This is their beta full-stack course.)

### The Oden Project

This is my chosen path for studying web development.

- Practice typing a little.
- Consider joining [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) once I get far enough along.
- Maybe also take the course [Learning how to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).
- When I inevitably need to ask for help, see [How to ask technical questions](https://www.theodinproject.com/guides/community/how_to_ask). (Consider using [replit](https://replit.com/) and/or [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) to share code, error messages, etc.)

## Computer Science “Bachelor’s Degree”

- [OSSU: Computer Science](https://cs.ossu.dev/)
- [Math Prerequisites](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-review-the-math-prerequisites) (Only if I find I need them. If so, use [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/).
