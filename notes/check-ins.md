## Check In #1 - 2025.01.21

As my first week of The Odin Project nears its end, I'm feeling good. Looking forward to continuing. 

**Highs:** After years of poking and prodding at my personal website off and on, I'm finally actually beginning to understand the how and the why of it all: The CASCADE! It explains so much. Also, finally grasping how flexbox works feels great. And becoming reacquainted with navigating through the terminal is fun.

**Lows:** The speed at which I work through the material is discouragingly slow at times. But I know I must brace myself, because it's only going to get slower as I go deeper.

**Shout-outs:** No particular shout-outs this week, as I haven't interacted with the community much yet. But I'm grateful that it's here.
