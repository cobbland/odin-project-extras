## Check In #1 - 2025.01.21

As my first week of The Odin Project nears its end, I'm feeling good. Looking forward to continuing. 

**Highs:** After years of poking and prodding at my personal website off and on, I'm finally actually beginning to understand the how and the why of it all: The CASCADE! It explains so much. Also, finally grasping how flexbox works feels great. And becoming reacquainted with navigating through the terminal is fun.

**Lows:** The speed at which I work through the material is discouragingly slow at times. But I know I must brace myself, because it's only going to get slower as I go deeper.

**Shout-outs:** No particular shout-outs this week, as I haven't interacted with the community much yet. But I'm grateful that it's here.

## Check In #2 - 2025.01.28

I can't believe I've only been working on The Odin Project for two weeks. Already feels like a lifetime, haha.

**Completion Status:** Foundations 87%

**Highs:** Interacting with and changing what's displayed on a webpage using JavaScript feels like wizardry and I'm here for it.

**Lows:** A few of those JavaScript exercises were tricky for me. (04_removeFromArray had me banging my head for an hour.) And while I eventually solved them, some of my methods were much more complicated than the clean code in the provided solution.

**Shout-outs:** No particular shout-outs this week, as I haven't interacted with the community much yet. But I'm grateful that it's here.

## Check in #3 - 2025.02.04

As the end of my first three weeks of The Odin Project quickly approaches, the enormity of the task ahead sets it.

**Completion Status:** Intermediate HTML and CSS 21%

**Highs:** Finishing Foundations felt so good. I've already learned so much.

**Lows:** Some of the array methods introduced at the end of JavaScript Basics tripped me up. And—somehow—I'm still occasionally tripped up by the cascade and flexbox. But I'll get there.

**Shout-outs:** Shout-out to nicO and xajx for awarding me with my first points, haha.

## Check in #4 - 2025.02.11

Coming up on a month doing The Odin Project—wild!

**Completion Status:** JavaScript 6% (Full Stack JavaScript path)

**Highs:** Finally getting back into JavaScript. After an hour or two of refreshing my memory, I finally feel like I am starting to really understand this stuff.

**Lows:** I thought the forms section of Intermediate HTML & CSS would never end. It wasn't too challenging—just a lot of reading and very boring. (Still glad to have done it, though.)

**Shout-outs:** No particular shout-outs this week, as I haven't interacted with the community much yet. But I'm grateful that it's here.

## Check in #5 - 2025.02.18

The Odin Project continues to dominate my year.

**Completion Status:** JavaScript 25% (Full Stack JavaScript path)

**Highs:** Finishing the library project. It's an actual working webapp! Sure, you can't save your data—yet. But it's still so cool that I made that.

**Lows:** I still have a bug with my library that I just can't figure out. It displays incorrectly on non-chromium based browsers.

**Shout-outs:** Shout-out to everyone in the [studying](https://discord.com/channels/505093832157691914/911690364103032864) channel. We're doing it!

## Check in #6 - 2025.02.25

This was a big week—I took my first day off, haha.

**Completion Status:** JavaScript 37% (Full Stack JavaScript path)

**Highs:** Finally finishing (and then squashing some, but certainly not all, bugs on) the todo list project.

**Lows:** That last todo list project was humbling for me. I learned a lot, but I also realized how much I really don't know.

**Shout-outs:** Shout-out to everyone in the [studying](https://discord.com/channels/505093832157691914/911690364103032864) channel. We're doing it!
