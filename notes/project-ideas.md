# Project Ideas

## Read and Highlight Together

A web app for sharing an epub to highlight and make notes on together.

Example: *Reading, highlighting, and taking notes on the Bible with a small study group.*

## Make Your Own Website

A personal website creation platform that uses activitypub and/or indieweb and is as easy to set up as making a new social media account. Static sites. Easy export to self-host or host elsewhere.

## IndieWeb/ActivityPub App

A webapp for sharing, commenting on, following, and posting. Also any RSS. (Sort of similar to [Tapestry](https://usetapestry.com/))

## Simple Dice Roller and Character Notes Keeper

Everything a player would need to play D&D in a super clean and simple format. Character info could be stored locally (in a json or something).

## DM "Screen"

A webapp that takes care of all the random generation roll type stuffâ€”weather, terrain generation, random encounters, etc. It would also have reference charts, notes, and things. It could also connect to the above project idea for added functionality, such as an overview of the party's stats. The Webapp could be made up of optional modules that stack together to make the "screen", similar to how it is on [5e.tools](https://5e.tools/dmscreen.html) but with a mobile-first design.
